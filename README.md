### Sheets2Calendar

A script for Google Sheets I wrote for a friend using Google Apps Script (GAS) that will add row values
to your Google Calender. This is an expansion of code written by Adam
Macfarland.

Feel free to leave me any questions or comments. If there are requests
for a UI, I would be happy to make one.

NOTE: This currently only works for calendars and sheets set to PST
(Pacific Time). I haven't figured out how to make this compatible with
other time zones. Additionally, I've seen people have issues with
DST, so please take note of this when using this code.
